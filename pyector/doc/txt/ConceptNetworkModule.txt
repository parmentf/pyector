Functionalities of the ConceptNetwork module
============================================

Introduction
------------

Version 0.1 of pyECTOR has only one module usable: ConceptNetwork.py.
Let's see what it can do.


Run it
------

src/ConceptNetwork.py is a import module, and is aimed to be used by Ector.py,
but it can also be run as a autonomous program. If you are in a shell, in the
root directory of the project, you can type:
-------------------
python src/ConceptNetwork.py
-------------------

Use it
------

When started, it loads an optional concept network from a file named `conceptnetwork.pkl`.
But the first time you run it, the ConceptNetwork is empty.

Add node
~~~~~~~~
You can add a basic node using the `@addnode` command, like that:
-------------------
@addnode from
Node "from" added
-------------------
All the text after the command becomes the symbol of the new node.

Add link
~~~~~~~~
To create a link, you need at least two nodes. So, let's create another one:
-------------------
@addnode to
Node "to" added
-------------------

*Note:* you could add a node which symbol contains a space, but you would not be
able to link it to another node, as the separator of the `@addlink`'s parameters
is _space_.

-------------------
@addlink from to
<__main__.Link instance at 0x01356440>
-------------------
This command creates a link from the "from" node to the "to" node. The command
displays the representation of the python object created, so you can know it has
succeeded.

Display nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can always display all nodes in the ConceptNetwork:
-------------------
@shownodes
from (basic): 1
to (basic): 1
-------------------
The `@shownodes` command displays one node per line:

  - the symbol of the node
  - the type of the node (`basic` for all nodes added thanks to `@addnode`command)
  - the occurrence of the node (the number of times the symbol has been added in
    the ConceptNetwork).

Activate a node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to enable the ActivationPropagation, one needs to activate at least one
node (setting its ActivationValue to 100 or less):
-------------------
@activate from
-------------------
In version 0.1, this command does not yield any output.

Display the activation values of the nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To see the state of the ConceptNetwork, use `@showstate`:
-------------------
@showstate
oldav	av	age	Node
100	13	1	from(basic)
0	63	0	to(basic)
-------------------
This command displays only the state of the nodes which have been active in less
than 50 ActivationPropagations:

  - old activation: the activation of the node at the beginning of the last
    activation propagation
  - activation value: the ActivationValue of the node at the end of the last
    activation propagation
  - age: number of activation propagations since the first activation of the
    node
  - node: symbol (type) of the node, which is the id of the node.

Online help
~~~~~~~~~~~
Except this page, you can use the `@help` command, which displays a list of the
available commands:
-------------------
@help
@help give this help
@addnode name: add the node given
@addlink node1 node2 [label]: add a link from node1 to node2
@activate name [activation value]: activate a node from its name
@propagate [nb]: propagate the activation nb times
@shownodes: show the nodes in the ConceptNetwork
@showlinks: show the links in the ConceptNetwork
@showstate: show the state of the nodes
@save: save the Concept Network and its state
@quit: quit without saving
