Introduction
------------

Ector.py is the python module which contains the Ector class, but also the main
program to use Ector.

This page explains how to use this program.


Run it
------

src/Ector.py is to be launched by typing this (provided that Python 2.5+ is
installed on your system) in a shell, in the root directory of the pyector
project:

--------------------
python src/Ector.py
--------------------

Options
~~~~~~~
There are several options you can use.

Here is the synopsis of the command (version 0.2):
--------------------
python Ector.py [-p username=User][-n botname=Ector][-l logfilepath=ector.log][-h]
--------------------

-p --person
^^^^^^^^^^^
This option gives the user name to Ector.
It is the name under which you are recognized by Ector.
It will be used to create a file `username_state.pkl` in which it will save the
last subjects you talk about (to simplify).

When you talk to Ector, you are named `username`, and nothing else. Don't use
other pseudos or nicknames.
The username is displayed before the prompt, so that you always know what's your
name ;)

By default, it is *`User`*.

You can always change this name during the interactive session by using the
`@person` command:

--------------------
User>@person Bill
Bill>
--------------------

-n --name
^^^^^^^^^
You can change the name of the bot, but its default name will be *`Ector`*.
The name you give is capitalized.

-l --log
^^^^^^^^
You can change the file in which the log is written.
By default, the file is `ector.log` and is saved in the current directory (from
where you launch Ector).

This is the same as the `@log` command.

-h --help
^^^^^^^^^
The help option reminds the usage of the program:
--------------------
$python src/Ector.py -h
Usage: Ector.py [-p username][-n botname=Ector][-v|-q][-l logfilepath=ector.log]
[-s|-g][-h]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p USERNAME, --person=USERNAME
                        set the name of the utterer
  -n BOTNAME, --name=BOTNAME
                        set the name of the bot
  -v, --verbose         say all that you can say
  -q, --quiet           shut up!
  -l LOGNAME, --log=LOGNAME
                        log the dialogue in log file
  -s, --sentence        set sentence reply mode on
  -g, --generate        set generate reply mode on
--------------------

Use it
~~~~~~
Once you have launch the program, you get some license and copyright information:
--------------------

@help gives a basic help on pyECTOR commands.
User>
--------------------

From there, you can either type sentences you want Ector to learn, or use some
commands.
Let's see these commands.

@help
^^^^^
Typing `@help`, then enter will display all available commands:
--------------------
User>@help
You can just start typing phrases.
But there are some commands you can use:
 - @usage     : print the options of the Ector.py command
 - @quit      : quit
 - @exit      : quit
 - @bye       : quit
 - @person    : change the utterer name (like -p)
 - @name      : change the bot's name (like -n)
 - @version   : give the current version
 - @write     : save Ector's Concept Network and state
 - @shownodes : show the nodes of the Concept Network
 - @showlinks : show the links of the Concept Network
 - @showstate : show the state of the nodes
 - @cleanstate: clean the state from the non-activated nodes
 - @log [file]: log the entries in the file (no file turns off the logging)
 - @status    : show the status of Ector (Concept Network, states)
 - @sentence [ON|OFF]: set the sentence reply mode
 - @generate [ON|OFF]: set the generate reply mode

--------------------

@usage
^^^^^^
Usage is the same than `-h, --help` option. It gives the synopsis of the program.

@quit, @exit, @bye
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`@quit`, `@exit`, and `@bye` are the same command: it is the only means to quit Ector.

WARNING: at this point, if you did not save the ConceptNetwork (using `@write`), all you said since the last save will be lost!

@person
^^^^^^^
The `@person` command let you change your name in the course of the interactive
session:
--------------------
User>@person Bill
Bill>
--------------------

WARNING: at this point, if you did not save, Ector won't remember your last
conversation state the next time you return as `User`.

@name
^^^^^
The `@name` command let you change the name of the bot, so that when you say
this new name, the bot knows it is him.

*Tip*: don't use this command too much, except if you want to call the bot
another name than "Ector".

@version
^^^^^^^^
Gives the current version of the program. :)

@write
^^^^^^
Writes the ConceptNetwork in `cn.pkl`, in the current directory, *and* the
ConceptNetworkState in `username_state.pkl`, in the same directory.

@shownodes
^^^^^^^^^^
This command displays the nodes of the ConceptNetwork, as in the
ConceptNetworkModule.

This won't display anything unless there are nodes in the ConceptNetwork.
A simple manner to add nodes, is to talk to Ector, naturally.

Example:
--------------------
User>Hi Ector, how are you?
User>@shownodes
       how (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
        Hi (   token): 1 (1,0,0)
Hi @bot@, how are you? (sentence): 1 (1)
       bot (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
         , (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
      User ( utterer): 1 (2008/11/11)
         ? (   token): 1 (0,0,1)
       are (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
       you (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
User>
--------------------

WARNING: this could overwhelm the screen, if your ConceptNetwork is already
big!

NOTE: at the launch, Ector try to read the `cn.pkl` file. If you already wrote
it, the ConceptNetwork shall not be empty.

@showlinks
^^^^^^^^^^
This command displays the links of the ConceptNetwork, like in
ConceptNetworkModule.

NOTE: Though it is useful to debug and understand how Ector works, you
should not use it, as the output is long.

Example:
--------------------
User>Hi Ector, how are you?
User>@showlinks
       bot ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
         , ------(100)------->        how
       how ------(100)------->        are
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->          ,
       how ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->         Hi
        Hi ------(100)------->        bot
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        you
       are ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
         ? ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->          ?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        bot
        Hi ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        are
       bot ------(100)------->          ,
       are ------(100)------->        you
         , ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
       you ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        how
      User ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->       User
       you ------(100)------->          ?
Ector >Hi User, how are you?
--------------------

@showstate
^^^^^^^^^^
This command displays the state of the nodes of the ConceptNetwork,
corresponding to the utterer, like in ConceptNetworkModule.

NOTE: Though it is useful to debug and understand how Ector works, you
should not use it, as the output is long.

Example:
--------------------
User>Hi Ector, how are you?
Ector >Hi User, how are you?
User>@showstate
oldav	av	age	Node
97	93	2	how(token)
97	90	2	Hi(token)
92	84	2	Hi @bot@, how are you?(sentence)
97	93	2	,(token)
97	90	2	@bot@(token)
82	65	2	User(utterer)
97	93	2	?(token)
97	90	2	are(token)
97	93	2	you(token)
--------------------

@cleanstate
^^^^^^^^^^^
This command, mainly aimed at debugging, can be used to clean the state
from non-activated nodes. It is much more readable when @showstate
display fewer nodes.

Example:
-------------------
User>But you don't have a mouth!
Ector > Don_'_t_have_a_mouth_! (a)
User>@showstate

@log
^^^^
This command change the way the log is taken, in two manners:

  1. change the file in which the log is automatically written
  2. stop the logging, giving no filename, or using `@logoff`

Example:
--------------------
User>@log
Log off (ector.log)
--------------------
The logging off display the last log file name.

To log on, or change the name of the log:
--------------------
User>@log test.log
Log file: test.log
--------------------

@status
^^^^^^^
The status command display the nodes of the ConceptNetwork, and the name of the
states that were created:

--------------------
User>@status
       how (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
        Hi (   token): 1 (1,0,0)
Hi @bot@, how are you? (sentence): 1 (1)
       bot (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
         , (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
      User ( utterer): 1 (2008/11/11)
         ? (   token): 1 (0,0,1)
       are (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
       you (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
States (1)
	User
--------------------

@sentence [on|off]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set sentence mode on or off.
When the sentence mode is on, Ector thinks a bit about what you said, and then
picks one sentence among those he has already heard.

Using `@sentence` without any argument gives the current sentence mode.

@generate [on|off]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set generate mode on or off.
When the generate mode is on, Ector thinks a bit about what you said, and then
generates a sentence from one of its activated tokens (usually, a word you used
in the previous sentence).
This generation is a contextually statistical one: likelihood of a word after
one another is taken into account, but activation of the word too.

Activation means concepts that are in the thinking process of Ector (concepts being
sets of tokens).
